PiniTree server is a single executable file precompiled for MacOS/darwin (intel or M1) and Linux.
To start a PiniTree server on port 7777, depending on your computer architecture from the command prompt execute one of:

./pinitree.darwin-amd64 -p 7777 -a &
./pinitree.darwin-arm64 -p 7777 -a &
./pinitree.linux-amd64  -p 7777 -a &

For a list of more options execute:

./pinitree.darwin-amd64 -help
./pinitree.darwin-arm64 -help
./pinitree.linux-amd64  -help

A fully featured PiniTree server will run without a licence for 1 month test period.
After that you will have to obtain a license key by purchasing a subscription to the http://pini.substack.com mailing list. 

The mailing list operates in the quiet mode (no push notifications) and contains detailed PiniTree documentation in the archive. It also allows for the communication with the developers and the PiniTree community.
